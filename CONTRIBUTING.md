# Contributing

We welcome your improvements to the text of the Fabulang stories.

## Guidelines

Please respect the following guidelines:

* You must only suggest edits in languages for which you possess a native level of understanding. **Please indicate if you are a native speaker** in your comments.
* Because each story is available in all languages, it is essential to ensure that edits in one language do not introduce a meaningful semantic different across the language versions. Consequently:
  * You must restrict editing only to **correct errors or improve phrasing**, while retaining as closely as possible all aspects of the meaning of each sentence.
  * Edits must not combine or split sentences or paragraphs.

Please also adhere to our general style guide:

* We do not use narrative tenses.
* We avoid loanwords unless it would be egregiously wrong to use the native word.
* The character names change between language versions to a similar name that is appropriate for the language, but it isn't important that the names are direct translations of each other.
* Bear in mind the CEFR level of the story, and where simpler/more fluid language is available, please use it appropriately.

## Attribution

A record of your edits is automatically kept in this repository, which anyone can see and verify. We do not currently have plans to credit people publicly for small edits. However, you can be credited as a Reviewer if you conduct a Full Review of the text.

## Full Reviews

Please indicate if the edits you propose are the result of a **comprehensive and detailed review of the entire story**. In other words, that you feel confident the rest of the story's text cannot be improved.

Full reviews are especially important and valuable, so we will be pleased to credit you as a Reviewer of the text if you wish (please indicate if so).
