# Copyright

The stories on Fabulang are protected under copyright and we reserve all such rights as may be available worldwide.

You may not use the stories for any purpose except personally as a language learner, or in an educational capacity as described below.

## Educational Use

If you teach languages either as:

* a personal tutor; or
* a tutor of small classes; or
* a school teacher (primary or secondary level); or
* a university professor

you may reproduce the text of the Fabulang stories, including any alterations you may wish to make, to use as reading material for your learners (such material hereafter referred to as "reproductions"); providing:

* you do so on a class-by-class basis; and
* you credit Fabulang clearly as the source of the story, ideally with a link to fabulang.com. If you have included your own alterations, you must also state this. For instance, you could include the attribution: "Based on a story from fabulang.com".

However, you must not under any circumstances:

* store such reproductions centrally so that they can be reused or accessed freely by other teachers or learners -- i.e. they must remain your personal teaching resources; or
* keep at your disposal reproductions of any significant proportion of the stories published by Fabulang, or any greater number than reasonably necessary to enhance your teaching; or
* distribute such reproductions beyond your immediate learners; or
* present such reproductions in any way that renders them publicly available; or
* charge for such reproductions in any way; or
* publish such reproductions in any form, including on any kind of website.

These exceptions and limitations are intended to allow teachers to make full use of the Fabulang stories for their teaching, while respecting our copyright. However, our preference would always be for teachers to direct their learners to the Fabulang website.
