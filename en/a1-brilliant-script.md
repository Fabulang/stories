Dominic turns on the lamp and sits down. He drinks his coffee. Finally, he has an idea.

He starts typing on his laptop. He is writing a script for a film.

"Everything is silent," he writes. "The security guard is sleeping. The secret letters are on the desk. The spy moves closer. Quietly, she ---"

Bang! Dominic jumps. The coffee spills on the laptop. The laptop stops working. The screen says: "Error!"

There are green and yellow lights outside the window. People are clapping. Dominic's neighbour is having a party. She is a famous film director. Bang! Another firework explodes in the director's garden.

In the bin, beside Dominic's desk, there is a letter. It says: "Please come to my party. We're celebrating my new film, 'Sorry, Mr Spy'. Your script is about a spy too, isn't it? Please tell me about it!"

Dominic closes the curtains. He cleans the laptop. He turns it off, then he turns it on again. It's working.

He starts a new script.

"The film director is having a party," he writes. "Her new film, 'The Apology', is very popular. In the middle of the party, her neighbour arrives.

"He's angry. 'Your films are rubbish,' he says. 'Popular, but rubbish. I'm writing a script that is brilliant. But I can't finish it, because you're making so much noise!'

"The next day, the director comes to apologise. She wants to read his script. But he closes the door. Finally, the director of 'The Apology' feels sorry. The End."

Dominic smiles. Then he clicks Delete.

The next day, someone knocks on Dominic's door. It's the director.

"Your new script is fantastic!" she says.

"What?"

"The director who feels sorry! I love it."

Dominic runs to his laptop. His script is still there. The laptop is emailing the script to everyone in his contacts. The screen still says: "Error!"

"But I ---"

"What a brilliant idea, Dominic, to make the film here, in my garden! Everyone's ready -- we're starting today. I know, we work too hard -- but we have a lot of parties too! Dominic? Are you alright?"
