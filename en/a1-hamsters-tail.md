"Look after the hamster," Elijah's teacher says. She goes to eat.

Elijah sits in the classroom. He watches the small hamster. It runs in its wheel, very fast. 'It's lunchtime,' he thinks. 'I must feed it.' He gives it some food and water. The hamster eats and drinks.

A little girl comes in. "Can I hold it?" she asks.

"Yes, but be careful," he says.

Elijah picks up the hamster and gives it to the girl. It is warm and soft, and the girl smiles. But the hamster bites her finger. "Ouch!" she says, and she drops the hamster.

The small animal runs out the open door. "No!" Elijah shouts. He and the girl run after it. Elijah can only see its tail, when it runs into the grass. The hamster is gone.

Elijah is very worried. 'I'm in trouble,' he thinks.

He takes out his phone and calls his mum.

"Mum, do you love me?" he asks.

"Of course, Elijah," she says.

"And will you always help me?" he asks.

"Yes, Elijah. What's wrong?" she asks. She sounds worried.

He takes a deep breath. "How quickly can you buy a hamster and bring it to school?"
