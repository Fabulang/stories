Every morning, Ariana wears a suit and goes to work in the city. But first, she always visits *Little Hot Cup*, a caf√© on her street. They make the best coffee in the world.

Ariana sits and drinks her coffee for five minutes. It is quiet, and the coffee is delicious. She doesn't enjoy her job. She works very hard. But she loves to drink her coffee. It's her favourite time of the day.

One Monday, Ariana wakes up. She feels tired. She does not want to go to work. But she thinks about the coffee, and she feels happy.

She goes to *Little Hot Cup*. But when she arrives, something is wrong. The lights are off. The door is closed. There is a piece of paper on the door. It says "Permanently Closed".

Ariana wants to cry. She looks through the window. The owner is sitting at a table. He looks sad too. Ariana goes inside.

"What happened?" she asks.

"My costs are too high," the owner says. "I have to close."

Ariana thinks she can help. "I'm an accountant," she says. "Maybe I can help."

"Really? That's wonderful!"

The owner shows Ariana lots of numbers. "I don't understand them!" he says.

But Ariana understands the numbers immediately. She gives the owner some ideas. She says "Good luck," and she goes to work.

One year later... Ariana wakes up. She feels tired, but she thinks about *Little Hot Cup*. She goes there with a smile. The lights are on. The door is open. The smell of coffee is fantastic.

She goes in. She sits down and enjoys her coffee for five minutes. Then she goes to the little office at the back. She goes inside.

"Welcome to work," says the owner. "Did I tell you? You're the best accountant in the world."
