Matthew is learning to be a wizard. He thinks he can be a very good wizard. But he is in the bottom class.

One day, he tries a big spell. He wants to have wings, so he can fly. It will show his teachers that he is a strong wizard. But he makes a mistake!

Lots of ducks appear. They are not just normal ducks. They are very friendly ducks. They like Matthew very much. They go with him everywhere. They walk behind him. They hug him with their wings.

The school becomes very noisy. The ducks go into all the classrooms. They sit on the tables. They play with the pens and papers. They even go into the kitchen. They eat a lot of the food.

The students think it is very funny. They laugh and clap. They take photos of Matthew and the ducks. Matthew makes a lot of new friends. Everyone wants to talk to him.

But the headmistress does not laugh. She calls Matthew to her office. Matthew is very scared. He thinks he will be expelled.

In the headmistress's office, Matthew is shaking. The headmistress is behind her desk. She looks at him. Then, she smiles.

"You are very good at magic," she says. "You made fifteen ducks appear, with just one spell. Only a strong wizard can do that. You are ready for the top class."
