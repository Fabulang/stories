It is dark. There is no moon in the sky. Two people walk quickly towards the school. It is an old building made of stone. It looks almost like a castle.

They stop at the main entrance.

"Third door ---" the man says. He is scared. He can't speak.

"You're safe here," says the woman.

The man breathes. "Go through the main hall. Then it's the third door on the left."

The man offers her a torch. "Take this." She pushes it away.

"But it's dangerous, Miss Steel! The previous person who..."

"I can't use it. In my profession, Headmaster... I must work in the dark. My... tools... are in my bag."

The man's face is white. "I don't want to know what's in there," he says. "Please just solve our... problem."

"Just send the second payment on time," says Miss Steel. Then she steps inside the school. The door slams behind her.

There is no light at all. She can't see anything. She touches the walls with her hands. The stone is cold.

She walks forwards. Her footsteps are loud. They are the only sound. She holds her bag close to her chest.

On the other side of the main hall, there is a long, narrow corridor. There are many doors on her left and right. She counts the doors. One, two, three. She stops. She holds her breath.

Under the third door, she can see some light. The light is very dim, with a pale purple colour. She listens. There is a tapping, scraping sound.

She enters the classroom. The door creaks loudly. The room is large, with many tables and chairs.

A little boy is sitting in one of the chairs. The purple light is coming from him.

Slowly, Miss Steel walks closer. She stands behind the boy. He is writing on a slate with a piece of chalk. She can see the white writing through the boy's back.

She needs to be closer.

"Can I sit with you?" she asks quietly.

The boy doesn't respond. The chalk taps and scrapes. Slowly, Miss Steel sits down. The boy is very cold. She can feel it.

"Are you another ghost killer?" says the boy suddenly. "I can hurt you too."

"I don't want to hurt you," says Miss Steel quickly. Too quickly.

"Five hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and forty six," says the boy. He is looking at the slate. There are numbers all over it. "Divided by forty-two thousand, eight hundred and twelve..."

"You're... doing maths?"

"I'm bad at maths!" the boy cries. "So the professor punished me. He gave me this question. He said: 'You can't leave until you solve it!' Five hundred and seventeen thousand..."

"And you're still trying? How long...?"

"I don't know... the candle is still... oh... where's the candle?"

The boy looks around for the candle. He isn't looking at Miss Steel.

Silently, Miss Steel opens her bag. Watching the boy, she searches inside her bag. Slowly, she takes out a small, black object. She puts it on the table.

"What's that?" says the boy suddenly.

"It's called a calculator."
