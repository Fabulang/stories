"Are you ready?" shouts Eliza's husband.

"I'm choosing my clothes," she replies.

"But it's been two hours!"

Eliza uses some perfume. She is ready for the party with her friends. She goes downstairs and into the kitchen.

She hits her knee on the chair.

"Ouch!" she shouts.

"What?"

"Nothing!"

"Eliza, you have to wear your new glasses," says her husband. "They are still in the box."

"I don't need glasses."

"I'm over here, darling," her husband says.

"I don't like my glasses."

"They are very elegant. You look very pretty with glasses."

Eliza doesn't respond. She goes to the dining room. Everything is ready for her guests. She puts some flowers in the vases, and she tidies the cushions on the sofas.

Her husband comes in.

"Why have you done that?" he asks.

"What do you mean?"

"There is a flower in each person's drink. And all the cushions are on the coffee table."

"That's the new style," Eliza says quickly. "It's very modern."

Her husband says goodbye. The party is for Eliza and her friends. "Enjoy the film," says Eliza. Her husband leaves. He goes to the cinema.

A little while later, Eliza hears the doorbell. She wants to open the door, but she can't find the key.

She takes a box out of her handbag. She takes her new glasses out of the box. She puts on the glasses. Now, she can see clearly. She opens the door.

"I love your new glasses!" says her friend.

Eliza and her friends have a wonderful party. Before they leave, everyone says that Eliza looks beautiful with her new glasses.

That night, Eliza's husband comes home.

"Welcome home --- Oh!" says Eliza.

She stops smiling and runs into the lounge. Her husband runs into the lounge as well. He looks very worried.

"What's wrong?" he asks.

"Nothing," says Eliza. "It's just that... I didn't realise..."

"Realise what?"

Eliza takes off her glasses. She smiles. She kisses her husband.

"You're so handsome," she says.
