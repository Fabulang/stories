Lily likes Luke, a boy in her class. He loves sport, but Lily doesn't. Lily loves to read. She feels sad -- she has no chance with Luke.

One day, Lily sees Luke drop a book. Lily is excited. Does Luke like to read? Then she sees the title of the book. It is called *Everything About Sport*.

But Lily has an idea. She picks up the book. She takes it home and reads all of it.

The next day, Lily sees Luke. She gives him back his book.

"I read your book," she says.

Luke looks surprised. "Did you enjoy it?" he asks.

"I love to read," says Lily. "Now I know about football, cricket, hockey and tennis. We can talk about them."

Luke laughs. "But *I* don't like sport," he says.

"What?" says Lily.

"My parents and teachers tell me to play," says Luke. "Actually, I love to read, too."

"Really?"

"Come to the library with me. It's my favourite place. I will show you a more interesting book than *Everything About Sport*."
