Ferdinand arrives on holiday. He is very excited. He wants to see the city. He wants to go shopping. But he is very tired. He falls asleep in his hotel room.

Ferdinand gets up and leaves the room. But he is not awake. He is sleepwalking!

He walks down the stairs and into the lobby. His eyes are open, but he is asleep. It's like a dream.

"Have a nice day," says the woman behind the desk.

"Cabbages and potatoes!" says Ferdinand. (People say strange things when they are dreaming.)

Ferdinand goes outside. It is a beautiful, sunny day. He goes into an ice cream shop.

"Hello, sir," says the seller. "Which ice cream would you like?"

"Cabbages and potatoes!" says Ferdinand.

"I'm sorry, sir, we don't have that flavour. Try this one. It's chocolate."

Ferdinand takes the ice cream. "How much?" Ferdinand asks, slowly.

"Five," says the seller.

"Five..." says Ferdinand, slowly.

Ferdinand gives the seller his wallet. The seller takes the money from the wallet, and gives it back.

Ferdinand eats his ice cream while he walks. Then he sees a souvenir shop. He goes inside. He picks up a pretty souvenir.

"How much?" Ferdinand says, slowly.

"Fifty," says the shopkeeper.

"Five..." says Ferdinand.

"No, it's fifty," says the shopkeeper.

"Five!" says Ferdinand.

"Alright, thirty," says the shopkeeper.

"Five!"

"Fine!" says the shopkeeper. "You tourists are becoming so clever!"

A few hours later... Ferdinand wakes up. He is in his hotel room. He smiles. "Now I can go shopping," Ferdinand thinks. "I must buy a souvenir. They're very cheap, here."

Ferdinand gets out of bed. He is surprised. His room is full of shopping bags. There are so many shopping bags, he can't move. He looks in his wallet. It is empty.

There is a note on the table. It says, "We bought all the things you asked for." It is from the hotel staff.

Ferdinand looks in the shopping bags. They are all full of cabbages and potatoes.
