One sunny day, a red balloon was in the park with a young girl. Suddenly, the balloon left her hand and went up into the sky.

"Come back!" the girl said.

It wanted to go down again. But the balloon went up and up.

First, it floated over the trees. There was an old bird resting at the top.

"Don't go higher," said the old bird. "You won't like it."

"I have to," said the balloon.

The balloon floated above the park. It saw children playing and laughing. Some of them were playing football. There was one boy who was on his own. He was watching the children play. The other children weren't playing with him.

It moved higher and saw a market. There, it saw people buying and selling things. They looked busy. There was a large family at the grocery store. The father was buying lots of fruits and vegetables for their dinner.

Then, the balloon rose very high. It saw the whole city below. It saw big houses and small houses. It saw rich people and poor people, old people and young people.

They all looked different, but they also looked the same. They laughed, cried, and had dreams.

Finally, the balloon began to lose air. Slowly, it started to come down. It was falling into a park again. It looked like the same park.

But when the balloon arrived, it wasn't sure. The grass and the trees were the same, but they looked different. The girl wasn't there. The balloon missed her.
