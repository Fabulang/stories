Miss Mouse was in her bedroom, in her house in the forest. Her house was inside a small log on the ground. It had four windows, a front door and a back door, and a little chimney.

Mouse was looking in her mirror. "My ears are so big," she said sadly. "The other animals laugh at me." She sighed.

Outside the log, Mr Fox was passing by. He heard what Mouse said. He walked closer, quietly.

"I wish I was like Butterfly," Mouse continued. "Everyone loves Butterfly. She's so pretty. Her wings are so attractive and colourful. And such small ears! Life is easy for her."

"Excuse me," said Fox.

Mouse jumped. She turned around. She could see one of Fox's eyes in each window.

Fox's voice was calm and friendly. "I feel sorry for you. I am very ugly too." The Fox sighed very loudly. "Life is cruel. Mice can use the magic lake to become beautiful, but foxes can't."

"Magic lake?" asked Mouse. "What are you talking about?"

"There is a magic lake in the forest. When mice swim in the lake, they turn into butterflies. Didn't you know?"

"No!" said Mouse, with wide eyes.

"Well, come out of your log, and I'll take you there," said Fox.

Mouse thought carefully. She looked in the mirror again. She saw her big ears.

"But I have to stay at home," Mouse said. "I almost forgot. My nieces and nephews are visiting me after school. I have to wait for them."

Now Fox's eyes were wide. "That isn't a problem at all," he said. "I'll carry you. We'll go to the Mouse School first. Then we'll all go to the magic lake together."

Mouse's little heart beat quickly while she put on her shoes. She opened the door. Fox was waiting patiently. Slowly, Mouse walked towards him.

When Mouse was in front of Fox's mouth, he said, "How many nieces and nephews? How young?"

"I have twelve nieces and eight nephews," said Mouse. "They're all taking their final exams. They're very cute."

"I can't wait to meet them."

Mouse climbed onto Fox's head.

"Go between those bushes, follow the river, then the school is in the field," said Mouse.

Fox began to run. Mouse could see Fox's tongue, licking his lips.

"I just need some water," said Fox. "Running is hard work."

"I'm sorry," said Mouse. "It's just over there."

They could see the field between two large trees. Fox ran quickly.

There was a loud bang. Fox screamed. His foot was stuck in a trap.

Mouse jumped off Fox's head, and began to walk home.

"Do you think I'm stupid?" she said.
