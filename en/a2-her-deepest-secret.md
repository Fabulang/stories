"There's something unusual about this painting," said the tour guide. "Can you see what it is?"

The tourists looked closely. Behind them, other tourists walked around the busy museum.

"It's the paint. It's thick," a woman said, loudly. She was wearing sunglasses and a large hat.

"It's an oil painting," said the tour guide. "That's normal."

"It's not realistic. The colours are dull."

"It's over three hundred years old. And you're wearing sunglasses, madam."

"Well, what then?" said someone else.

"The woman in the painting... no one knows who she is. But we can discover a lot about her, by looking closely. In fact, we can discover her deepest secret."

"She was very intelligent," said the loud woman's son. The boy let go of his mother's hand and stepped forward.

"Be quiet, Lewis," said the mother. "You're embarrassing me."

"How do you know?" asked the tour guide.

"She has so many shelves full of books. There is a desk in the room, with paper and ink. She likes to study."

"Very good!" said the tour guide. "The artist wanted us to notice those things. He's telling us who she was."

The other tourists nodded and looked impressed. The mother wasn't looking.

"She loves to travel," Lewis continued.

"Lewis!" said the mother. She turned to the tour guide. "I'm sorry about my son. I can't teach him to be quiet."

"I can see why that's difficult for you," said someone.

"Yes, he's a very difficult child."

"Why do you think she liked to travel?" the tour guide asked Lewis.

"The style of the room is European. But look around. The rug is Indian. That ornament is from Peru, I think. And the mirror looks ---"

"Do as you're told, Lewis!" said the mother, closing her handbag. "We're leaving."

After Lewis and his mother had left, a man asked, "But what was the secret?"

"Look in the corner."

"Are those... children's toys?"

"Yes! But why did the artist paint those? He's telling us the woman had a child -- *their* child. Their love was a secret, but he wanted us to know. Now, please follow me..."

"You must learn to be quiet!" the mother said to Lewis as they left the museum.

It was evening and the city was busy, loud and full of bright lights.

"But they still didn't notice the real secret!" said Lewis.

"I'm glad they didn't. After your father died, I wanted to burn the painting. But I'm glad I sold it, so I can still see it, from time to time."

"But Father hated living in secret! He wanted people to understand you! That's why he painted you realistically -- without a reflection in the mirror!"
