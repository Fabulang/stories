Jack lived in a small town. Everyone liked to live there, except Jack. Everyone thought it was a pretty town, except Jack.

Jack wanted to leave the country. He wanted to see new places. Beautiful places. So he bought a boat. That evening, he started his journey.

On the third night, there was a big storm. The wind and waves pushed his boat forward and backward, left and right. Very quickly, he was lost.

Jack woke up on an island. It was beautiful. There were trees with tasty fruit, and lots of fish in the sea. Jack was alone, but he was happy.

"This country is beautiful," Jack said to himself. "This is where I wanted to live."

One day, he climbed a tall tree. He looked around and saw something. There were lights in the distance. He looked carefully. Then he was surprised.

"That's my town!" he said. "That's my house!"

His island was not far from his town. He laughed. His country was more beautiful than he knew.

Jack returned to his boat. He went home. He was happy to see his neighbours again. That evening, they had dinner together.

His adventure had taught him something important. Sometimes, what we're looking for is closer than we think.
