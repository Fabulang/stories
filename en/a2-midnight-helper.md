Dennis was dreaming about maths. The numbers and symbols were attacking him. He hadn't done his homework. The questions were too difficult.

Dennis woke up. "My teacher will be mad at me, tomorrow," he thought.

Then he heard a strange sound. It was like a pencil writing on paper. At first, he thought it was a ghost, and he was scared. Then he thought, "I'm still dreaming." He fell asleep again.

In the morning, Dennis found a piece of paper on his desk. There were lots of numbers on the paper. They were the answers to his maths homework! He quickly copied the answers into his book. Then he went to school.

That evening, Dennis had more homework. He didn't know how to solve the equations. But maybe he didn't need to. He left the homework on his desk. In the morning, he found a note with all the answers.

"It's a helpful ghost!" Dennis thought. "I don't mind ghosts if they do my homework!"

Once again, he copied the answers quickly, then went to school.

A few weeks passed, and Dennis's teachers were impressed. He had become an excellent maths student. All of his answers were correct. He solved all the equations. Dennis started to feel proud. He liked maths now.

One day, the teacher called Dennis to her desk.

"I know," she said.

How did she find out about the ghost? Dennis had to tell the truth. "I didn't ask the ghost to do it. But it was so helpful..."

"Ghost?" said the teacher. "Don't lie, Dennis. I know your older sister is giving you the answers."

"My sister?" said Dennis. "She isn't helping me! It's ---"

"Read this question, Dennis!" shouted the teacher. She was angry.

"Two X minus four equals zero. What is X?" said Dennis.

"Now read your answer," said the teacher.

Dennis read what he had written: "X equals four divided by two. Therefore X equals two, love from Susan."
