A long time ago, life was dangerous. There was a small town in the desert. A man called Mark lived there. Mark's job was to keep the town safe.

When dangerous criminals came to the town, Mark had to stop them. Sometimes, he had to use his gun. He didn't like doing it, but there was no choice.

Mark did the job for forty-five years. Then the people said he was too old to keep them safe. They said "Thank you" to Mark, then gave Mark's gun to a young man called Joe.

"I'll teach you," Mark said to Joe.

"You're old and tired," said Joe. "What can you teach me? Nothing."

One day, a criminal came to the town. No one knew his name. But they knew what he had done, in the nearby towns. There, a lot of people tried to stop him. He killed all of them. When their children cried, he laughed. People called him 'the Wolf'.

Now, the Wolf was here. He was walking through the streets with his gun. At each house, he knocked on the door. If they didn't open the door, he shot through the door. If they did open the door, he told them to give him their money. He put the money in his bag.

Then the Wolf arrived at Joe's house. He knocked on the door. The door opened. Joe was standing there. "Wait!" said Joe. "Please don't shoot me. Take my money. Take everyone's money."

"Stop that right now," shouted Mark.

Mark was standing in the empty street. The Wolf turned around. Joe closed the door quickly. The Wolf walked into the middle of the street. He turned towards Mark and smiled.

"Or what?" said the Wolf.

"Or I'll stop you," said Mark.

"You're an old man. What can you do? Go and rest in your bed."

Mark shot the Wolf.

"You shot me!" shouted the Wolf, surprised. He fell down.

"I'm too old and tired to wait," said Mark. "I say this. You say that. We look at each other. No one moves. The street is quiet. Who will shoot first? And so on."

Mark put away his father's old gun. He walked forward, and took the Wolf's bag. Everyone came and took their money. "Thank you, Mark," they said. When the bag was empty, Mark dropped it next to the criminal. The Wolf was dead.

"Mark?" said Joe. "I'm sorry. Will you teach me?"

"Tomorrow," said Mark. "I'm tired."
