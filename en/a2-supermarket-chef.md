Joe had a job at a supermarket. He wanted a promotion, but his boss always said, "Joe, you are not talented."

One day, a man asked Joe to help him.

"I need chillies, herbs and spices," he said.

"Follow me, sir," Joe said.

Joe found the items quickly.

"Next, I need bread and chocolate," said the man.

Joe thought for a moment. He realised the man was making a Mexican dish. Joe's mom was from Mexico. She showed him how to make the dish. He had cooked it many times. Every time, he made it better.

"I know this dish," said Joe. "I use a special ingredient."

"What is it?" asked the man.

Joe wrote his recipe on a piece of paper, and gave it to the man. The man was very excited.

Joe's boss found him. "Joe, you are wasting time. You should be at the till," she said. Joe said goodbye to the man.

The next day, the man came back. Joe's boss said, "Yesterday, you wasted time because of him. Don't talk to him. Tell him to leave."

But the man had a surprise. He took off his hat and glasses.

Now, Joe and his boss recognised the man. He was a famous chef.

"Joe, your recipe was delicious," he said. "You are very talented. I want you on my television show."

They left in the chef's fancy car. Joe could hear his boss shouting: "I said don't talk to him!"
