"It's definitely an alien language," Alison confirmed.

The General nodded silently. Alison was standing inside a secret military base. There was computer equipment everywhere. There were two soldiers with guns standing by the door.

Alison was an expert linguist. As soon as the satellites had received the strange signal, the military had brought her to the base.

"This is a matter of extreme importance to the whole planet," said the General. "It's the President's top priority. Name anyone you need, and I'll get them on your team. We need to understand what that message says."

Alison gave him a list of researchers she'd worked with in the past. The General left. The soldiers saluted.

Alison and her team worked day and night to decode the alien message. At first, progress was slow. Then, they began to make breakthroughs. They learned to understand the alien language's unusual grammar. One by one, the words began to make sense.

A few weeks later, Alison reported to the General.

"We've finished the translation," said Alison timidly, looking at her feet. "It says ---"

"Stop right there," the General interrupted. "You should tell the President, not me."

The next day, the President arrived with an army of advisors, ministers and journalists. She shook hands with everyone, then she sat down behind a large table.

"That's your cue," said the General. He pushed Alison forward.

Alison sat down opposite the President. The cameras flashed.

"Alison, the whole world thanks you and your team for your diligent work to determine the meaning of this alien signal," said the President.

"Thank you," Alison whispered into the microphone.

"Tell us straight away: is it a message of war?"

"No," said Alison, without looking up.

The journalists cheered and clapped. "Then it is a message of peace!" she said, smiling.

"No," said Alison.

The applause died down. The journalists began to murmur.

"Well, what does it say?" said the President at last.

Alison gulped, and took a deep breath.

"The local services will not collect rubbish bins that are too full."
