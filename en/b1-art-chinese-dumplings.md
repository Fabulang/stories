Roxanne's food blog was one of the most popular cookery websites on the Internet. People loved her blog because it contained only the very best recipes that she'd discovered while travelling the world.

When Roxanne was in China, she knew she had to find the best recipe for Chinese dumplings. And everyone she asked said the same thing. "No one makes better dumplings than Mr. Chen," they said. "But he'll never tell you the secret!"

Roxanne found Mr. Chen's house and knocked on his door. The 80-year-old man welcomed her in with a smile. He told her that he enjoyed her blog, and was delighted to make his dumplings for her.

When Roxanne tried them, she could believe that they were the best in all of China. They were beautiful and full of delicious flavours. But when Roxanne asked for the recipe, Mr. Chen politely refused.

"I promise never to tell anyone else," said Roxanne. "I just want to know the secret!"

Mr. Chen thought about it. "You have to prove it," he said.

"How can I do that?"

Mr. Chen smiled. "Mow my lawn for an entire year."

"What?"

"Nevermind," he said. "If you don't want to know the secret, that's no problem."

"I'll do it," said Roxanne.

So, Roxanne changed her plans. Her trip to China became a long stay. She learned all about its amazing history, culture and -- most importantly -- delicious food. She wrote blogs about her experiences, and they became the most popular blogs on her website.

Every week, she returned to Mr. Chen's house and mowed his lawn. Mr. Chen watched carefully, to check she did it properly. Then he served a plate of hot dumplings, and they talked for hours about food.

"Mr. Chen, it's been one year," said Roxanne eventually. "It's time to reveal your secret."

"I've already revealed it," said Mr. Chen. "My secret is hard work. I've made dumplings over a hundred thousand times. That is the only way to make them so delicious. Dedication, practice and time. Why did I make you mow my lawn again and again? Because now you truly understand this secret."

Roxanne was annoyed, amused and appreciative all at once.

"You also wanted someone to mow your lawn for free," she said, laughing.

Mr. Chen offered a plate. "Dumpling?"
