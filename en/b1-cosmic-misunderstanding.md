Clare was a dedicated astronomer, always watching the skies. One night, she spotted a huge meteor that seemed to be getting closer to Earth.

"It's coming right at us!" she exclaimed.

She emailed her colleagues about it. Many days passed, and none of them responded. When she asked them in person, they said they didn't believe her.

Clare decided to build a rocket. "At least I will escape!" she declared.

During the day she worked on her rocket. At night, she packed her bags and planned her journey to the stars.

Finally, it was the day of the launch. Trembling, Clare climbed into her rocket and soared into space.

She gazed into the stars -- her new home. Then the meteor passed in front of her window.

Clare looked at the meteor, and realised something. It wasn't a meteor at all -- it was a satellite!

"Wait a minute," she said, looking closer. "This is the *Space Guard*, the lost satellite designed to identify dangerous meteors!"

Clare put on her suit and went into space with her tools. She flew over to the satellite, and began to work. Eventually, she managed to restart the satellite. She sent it back on its mission.

When she returned to Earth, she was greeted with surprise and admiration.

"Clare," said one scientist, "because you fixed the *Space Guard*, we were able to identify a dangerous object. It was coming towards the Earth at incredible speed. With the *Space Guard*, we were able to stop it!"

Clare had become a famous scientist. And she had learned that even a misunderstanding can lead to great things -- if you can look beyond the stars.
