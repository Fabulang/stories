Edward was the librarian of the quiet city library. He lived among books. He gave people books and took them back. But he never read them himself.

One day, he found a strange note in a returned book. It contained a riddle.

"Hmm," said Edward, intrigued. "This seems like a treasure hunt. If I solve it, I'll be rich!"

The riddle described a famous statue. Edward went there, and found another note, in the statue's hand. The new note had another riddle, but it also had the title of a book.

Edward found the book in the library. He had never read it. But now he read it with interest.

Once he had read the book, he understood what the riddle meant. It was talking about the old theatre. When he went there, he found another note hidden in the entrance hall. It contained another riddle, and the title of another book.

The riddles sent Edward all over the city, and all around the library. For weeks, he worked hard to read the books and solve the riddles.

At last, he found the final clue. It led him to an old tree in the park. Hidden on a branch, he found a final note.

It said: "Congratulations! You've solved the riddle of reading. Your prize? A lifetime of knowledge. Keep reading!"

Confused and disappointed, Edward returned to the library. He found a woman waiting for him. It was Professor Quill, a retired literature teacher known for her love of riddles.

"You see, Edward," said the professor, "the real treasure has always been in your hands -- the books! They're full of stories, knowledge and wisdom!"

Edward laughed, realizing the truth. He had read the books so he could find the treasure, but he also really enjoyed reading the books.

From that day on, every book he read became a treasure. And from time to time, he'd find another note from Professor Quill, leading him on a new adventure.
