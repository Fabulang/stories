Mister Thomas lived alone in a quiet town. He was a retired spy, so he kept watch over the neighbourhood. He was always looking for anything suspicious.

One day, new neighbours moved in next door. Mister Thomas watched them carefully. At first, they seemed like a normal couple. But soon, he saw them doing something strange.

Every evening, they went into their garden. They were gardening. Even stranger, they were whispering at the same time.

"That's suspicious," Mister Thomas thought, watching them from his window. "What are they whispering about? They're hiding something."

Mister Thomas decided to investigate. That night, he went into their garden. But he knocked over a spade, and it made a loud noise.

His neighbour opened his bedroom window. "Who's there?" he said.

"Err... just a cat!" Mister Thomas said, in a moment of confusion.

The next night, he tried to listen through his fence, but he only heard discussions about roses and daisies.

"Code words, surely," he thought. "I need more information."

So, the next night, he sent his robotic vacuum cleaner under the fence. He had attached a small camera on top.

The next morning, he turned on his computer to watch the video. But, the camera had fallen off on the other side of the fence. The video showed eight hours of the same rose.

Mister Thomas was losing hope. But then it was all revealed.

That afternoon, he saw lots of vans arrive. Lots of people came out and ran into the neighbours' house. Then, the neighbours came out with them again, and waited in their garden.

"Finally, the truth!" Mister Thomas exclaimed, watching closely.

The people took a large sign out of the van, and put it in front of the house. It said: "Welcome to the Gardening Show". They brought out big cameras, and turned them on.

Everyone clapped, and the couple smiled at the cameras.

"They've been getting ready to appear on television!" Mister Thomas said to himself, laughing.

When the show came on television, Mister Thomas watched it.

"We like to do gardening in the evening," said his neighbour, "when it isn't so hot. But if we need to talk, we always whisper, so that we don't wake up our neighbour, Mister Thomas. He is very strange!"
