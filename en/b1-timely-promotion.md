Jane's first job was in a busy office. It was a boring job. Then, one day, she had a strange accident with the coffee machine that changed her life.

Lightning struck the roof while she was making coffee. The machine glowed blue with electricity. The electricity jumped onto her metal watch, and she felt a shock.

She spilled the coffee, but she was alright, and she continued to work. But for the rest of the day, she felt strange. She felt powerful. That evening, she understood. She could now control the speed of time!

The next day, Jane had to complete a big, boring report. So she jumped forward in time, by one hour. When she opened her eyes, she had completed the task. It was her work, but she didn't remember doing it.

"Amazing," she said. "Now I don't have to feel bored anymore!"

From then on, if a task was boring, she jumped over it. For small tasks, she jumped a few hours. For big projects, she jumped a few days. And because she never felt bored, all her work was full of good ideas.

Soon, she was jumping weeks, then months. Everyone was amazed. She was doing a lot of work, quickly, and it was always excellent. Her boss said, "Jane, you'll be promoted this year. I promise!"

Jane decided to jump forward to the day of her promotion. She closed her eyes and touched her watch. When she opened her eyes, the office had changed. There were decorations, and there was a big cake on a table. Everyone was smiling at her. But she didn't know who they were.

"Congratulations, Jane!" said someone. "You've worked for the company for fifty years. Happy retirement!"

"Oh dear," Jane said, seeing her grey hair in her reflection in the window.

Everyone gave her gifts. Each person shared stories of Jane's hard work throughout the years, and her many achievements.

It was a great party, and Jane decided to enjoy it. The cake was delicious, and everyone was friendly and kind.

"I'll never use my power again," Jane said to herself. "I'll enjoy every moment. Every second. Every slice of cake."
