Amelia was in an antiques shop, looking for something to put on her wall. In the dark at the back, she spotted a beautiful, ancient mirror. It had an ornate frame carved in the shape of a snake with two heads.

"You don't want that one," came a harsh voice. It was the antiques dealer.

"But I do!" said Amelia. "I want it very much. I'll pay any price."

"Take it!" grumbled the dealer. "There is no price. But it will cost you dearly -- in the end!" And the old man rushed into his office, laughing to himself.

Amelia had met many antiques dealers. Many of them were even stranger. Delighted with her good luck, she picked up the mirror and left.

She brought the mirror home, cleaned it meticulously, and hung it on her bedroom wall. It looked extremely grand. It made her feel like a queen when she got dressed the next morning.

A few weeks later, Amelia was looking in the mirror as she got ready for bed. Suddenly, she heard a hissing sound. The next moment, although she didn't move, her reflection turned around and walked away.

"Come back!" Amelia exclaimed, in shock.

Her reflection jumped with fright and turned back. It stared at her, equally surprised. For a moment, they just stood still and looked at each other.

"Who are you?" Amelia asked.

"I'm me," said her reflection. "I'm Amelia."

"No, *I'm* Amelia," Amelia insisted. "You're my reflection."

"I don't mean to be rude," said her reflection, "but that's complete nonsense. I don't just live in this room, you know. I've got a whole life. There's a whole world here."

"Well, here too," said Amelia. "But your life is just a reflection of mine. You didn't exist until I put the mirror on my wall."

"What are you talking about?" said her reflection. "*I* put the mirror on *my* wall."

The two women stared at each other with frustration. They searched each others' faces, then the beds behind them, the furniture, and the whole room -- but everything was identical.

"Aha!" cried Amelia at last. "I can prove you are the reflection."

"Oh really?" Her reflection crossed her arms.

"Yes. I can see the clock on your wall. Number one is to the right of number twelve! Just like in a mirror!"

Her reflection thought about this. Then it smiled, picked up a large book, and threw it at the mirror.

Amelia sighed. She picked up the pieces of glass and put them in the bin.
