"Sweet dreams, darling," said Dorothy's mum. She switched off the light and closed the door.

Dorothy felt safe. Her pillow was soft and her duvet was thick and warm. Around her bed were her favourite toys: lots of different kinds of aeroplanes. It was her dream to become a pilot.

She closed her eyes, then she opened them again. She had heard a sound under her bed.

She didn't believe in monsters. So she got out of bed and looked under it. There were two large white eyes looking at her.

Dorothy gasped. The monster made a squeaking sound and ran towards the window. Dorothy could see it in the moonlight. It looked like a big ball of hair with two bright eyes.

"Don't be frightened," said Dorothy. "I'm a human. What are you?"

"I don't know what I am," said the monster. It had a squeaky voice. "I live under beds. Everyone is scared of me. When someone finds me, I have to find a new bed."

"You can live under my bed," said Dorothy. "Are you hungry? What do you eat?"

"Dust, hair, fingernails..."

"Eww!" Dorothy giggled.

"Spiders, flies," the monster continued, giggling too. "Woodlice, ants..."

"Stop it!" Dorothy laughed.

"Who are you talking to?" called Dorothy's mother.

"I was dreaming!" Dorothy shouted. She and the monster couldn't stop laughing.

Twenty years later, Dorothy relaxed in her seat. It was a beautiful day. There were a lot of clouds, but Dorothy could feel the sun on her skin, because she was above the clouds.

"All systems are normal," she said to the co-pilot. "We are on course and will arrive on time."

"No storms have been reported," said the co-pilot. "This will be an easy, normal flight. Oh my god, what is that?"

Dorothy's monster had jumped onto her lap.

"Get back in my bag!" Dorothy said quickly.

"But I miss you!" the monster squeaked.

"Shoo!" The monster jumped back in.

"Was that a cat? You can't bring your pet into the cockpit!"

"You're imagining things," Dorothy said. "I didn't see anything."

"This is very serious," said the co-pilot. He called the senior air hostess, and she came into the cockpit. "Please look in Dorothy's bag."

As soon as the air hostess opened the bag, the monster jumped out. The air hostess screamed, and the co-pilot got out of his seat. He tried to catch the monster, but it bounced all over the cockpit.

"Leave it alone!" Dorothy cried.

The air hostess tried to kick it, but she kicked Dorothy's controls by accident. The plane sped up.

"STOP!" Dorothy shouted.

She grabbed the monster and put it on her head.

"You idiots!" Dorothy shouted. "You're attacking my wig!"

"Your wig?" cried the air hostess. "But it was jumping!"

"It's an elastic wig!" said Dorothy, thinking quickly. "It has a rubber base. So it sticks to my head."

"But you don't need a wig!" said the co-pilot. "You have plenty of hair!"

"I want to change my hairstyle. Do I need your permission?"

The co-pilot returned to his seat. The air hostess put her hat back on. Later on, she wondered: Did the pilot's wig have eyes?

Fifty years later, Dorothy got into bed and under her warm duvet. She read a book for a little while. It was one of her favourites, about travelling the world. Eventually, she put the book down. The house was very quiet.

"Goodnight," she said.

Slowly, the monster came out from under the bed. It sat on her lap. All of its hair was grey. Dorothy stroked it.

"Sweet dreams, Dorothy," croaked the monster. It went back under her bed, and Dorothy switched off the light.
