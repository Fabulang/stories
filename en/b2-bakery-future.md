Edith didn't like how much technology there was these days. When she was young, things were much simpler. Now, everything had a battery, or flashing lights, or artificial intelligence. It was all too much for her.

One day Edith visited the local bakery. But instead of her friend the baker, she was greeted by a shiny robotic assistant.

"Who are you?" she asked. "What are you?"

The robotic assistant replied, "Hello Madam. I am the robot baker. I am here while the human baker is on holiday. I promise I will offer the same level of service that you are used to."

Edith did not like this at all.

"I'll have a loaf of bread, please," Edith grumbled.

"Certainly, may I scan your eye for payment?" the robot responded, and a sharp tool came out of its body and towards her face.

"Get away!" she shouted, jumping backward. "What's wrong with a bank note?"

The robot blinked its LED lights, seemingly confused. "I'm sorry, but we only accept electronic payments, with eye verification," it explained.

"This is madness! I just want to buy some bread!"

"I apologise Madam. We do offer an alternative," said the robot.

"What's that?" Edith asked.

"If you listen to three adverts and share our page on social media, you can have a loaf of bread for free," the robot said happily.

Edith turned and stormed out of the store without saying anything else.

As she made her way home, her phone rang. She saw it was a call from her friend, the baker.

"So, enjoying your holiday while technology takes over, huh?" Edith shouted into the phone.

"Actually, I'm still stuck at the airport!" cried the baker. "They won't let anyone fly without a microchip in their head!"
