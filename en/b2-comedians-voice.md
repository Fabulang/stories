Frank, an emerging talent in the world of stand-up comedy, was respected for his incredible ability to impersonate celebrities.

He was so good at copying their voices, gestures, and even facial expressions, that audiences would laugh uncontrollably. But as his success increased, his internal sadness grew more profound.

From his early years, Frank had been doing impersonations. It was because he believed that he was a boring person. But if he portrayed someone else, people found him entertaining.

Now, he was a professional comedian, but he was still doing the same thing. Frank wished he could express his own unique voice.

During a performance one night, he had to stop for a moment when the intense stage lights shone in his eyes. When he recovered, Frank decided he'd had enough. He stopped impersonating a famous singer and began to improvise.

"You know, I sing in the shower every day," he began. He didn't know where his joke was going. "Have you noticed how great your voice sounds in the bathroom? I often think, maybe I should quit comedy and become a pop star. Then I step out and see myself in the mirror."

Frank carried on sharing personal stories about his morning routine, his pet's odd behaviour, and a past job interview where he accidentally wore his suit inside out.

As he continued, Frank realised that the audience were not just laughing politely. They were roaring with laughter. And there was no one on the stage but him.
