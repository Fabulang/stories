Most people say they don't believe in ghosts. Until they see or hear one, themselves. That's when they call a ghost hunter. That's when Christian's phone rings.

There was a little town in a forgotten part of the country, where an old theatre was slowly falling apart. There hadn't been a performance in fifty years or more. No one living had ever been inside. People barely noticed it -- until the singing started.

Every night, at midnight, a haunting voice echoed from deep inside the theatre. At first, people ignored it. Just kids playing games, they thought. But the voice was too powerful, too old, too sad. A few people went inside to tell the singer to be quiet. The stage was empty.

In his research, Christian had learned that the theatre was originally built by Adelaide the Magnificent, one of the most famous singers of her day. She had grown up in the town, before leaving and becoming famous overseas.

Later on, she returned to the town, built the theatre and performed in nearly all its shows for twenty years. The town's mayor had given her an Award of Honour on her sixtieth birthday, to recognise the years of entertainment she had provided to local people.

Christian checked his watch. It was nearly midnight. He was sitting in the dark, inside the theatre, on one of the balcony seats. He stayed absolutely still and silent, watching the stage. Then the town's clock chimed twelve times.

A ghostly light filled the stage, and the ghost of Adelaide the Magnificent appeared. Her skin was as pale as bone, and her fine dress was torn and dirty. Yet, she looked beautiful.

Then she began to sing. It was the saddest sound Christian had ever heard. Her voice trembled with emotion as she glided slowly across the stage. By the time she sang the final note, Christian was in tears.

He jumped from his seat and clapped loudly. "Magnificent!" he cried.

The ghost saw him. She looked surprised. Then she bowed deeply. She didn't rise back up. She just disappeared.

After Christian left the town, he did some more research. Decades ago, everyone in town had gathered every night to enjoy the theatre's latest performance. They sang, laughed and cried together. It had been the heart and soul of the town.

Adelaide's ghost never appeared again. Time had moved on, and she rested in peace. But for one final night, she had sung to an audience, touched his heart, and bowed to his applause.
