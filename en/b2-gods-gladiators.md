The gladiators were ready to fight. One was a large man with big muscles. The other was skinny and short.

"I'll bet ten gold coins that the strong man wins," said Lucia's master.

"No, master!" Lucia whispered.

The master slapped her. "Don't disturb me when I'm gambling," he snapped.

"You are very harsh with your slaves," said the master's friend.

"That makes them work quickly. Not like your slaves, who smile all day."

Ten minutes later, the crowd was cheering. The skinny gladiator was bleeding, but he jogged out of the arena. 

"Bad luck," said the master's friend sympathetically.

The master was silent as he gave his friend the coins, one by one.

At home, the master grabbed Lucia. "You knew which gladiator would win. Tell me how!"

Two days ago, at midnight, the god Apollo had visited Lucia. He had offered her a choice: gain the ability to see what will happen, but lose the ability to lie. So, she had to tell her master everything.

"I will use Apollo's gift to please you," she said. "That's all I want."

"If you use it to help *anyone* else, Lucia," said the master, "I'll kill you. Understand?"

One week later, the master met his friend again. "Let's play for twenty gold coins, today," said the master. "I'll bet on the fat guy."

Lucia coughed loudly.

"Actually, I like the tall one," the master said. "He looks like me."

"Fine," said his friend, "but what happened to your slave girl? She's covered in bruises!"

"That's none of your business," the master snapped. "Will you play?" They shook hands.

After a horrible fight, the master laughed at his friend. "You should lose more often," said the master. "I like you more when you lose!"

Over the next few months, the master's wealth doubled and tripled. And although he could win anywhere, he loved winning against his friend the most. Each week, he insisted on a larger bet. Slowly, the master's friend lost a fortune.

One evening, during a banquet at the master's house, Lucia offered him a large plate full of delicacies she had made.

"What is this?" he asked.

"Stewed apricots, freshly-baked bread, stuffed olives ---"

The master slapped her. "I'm not blind. What is this knife for? I'm an important man now. Do you expect me to slice the bread myself?"

He pushed her away, and she tripped. The dish fell. Lucia hit her head on the floor.

At that moment, the door burst open. The master's friend charged into the room.

"Cheater!" shouted the friend. "I believed you were lucky. But you have no honour!"

The master stood up. "You were not invited! How dare you insult me in front of my guests!"

"In fact, I've come to gamble with you. Will you play? If I win, I will take what you owe me. If you win, you will take my house, everything in it, and the rest of my money."

The master's eyes opened wide. "And the game?"

"Fight me to the death! Right now! The gods will protect the man who has more honour."

The master laughed loudly. His friend was smaller, weaker and much older.

"Lucia, come here," the master said.

Lucia came quickly. Her ear was bleeding.

"I will kill him quickly, yes?" he whispered.

Lucia looked at her master's friend. The friend looked at her. He saw that she was bleeding. His eyes were full of sympathy.

Lucia saw what would happen.

"How dare he insult you," she said carefully. "The fight will last less than a minute... Afterwards... everyone will congratulate my master. They will call him a man of honour. And tomorrow, I will smile all day."
