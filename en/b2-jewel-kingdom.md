"You cannot stop me," laughed Moros, the evil tyrant. "Now I shall use the Jewel of Power to conquer the kingdom! Drop your weapon, Eravon, or she dies."

Moros was holding his sword against the Princess's neck.

"The gods have truly forgotten us," said Eravon.

A tear rolled down his cheek as he let his bow fall to the ground. There was no hope left. Moros had won.

Gabrielle let her pen fall. The final battle between Eravon and Moros was the subject of her latest fantasy novel, *The Jewel of the Kingdom*. Millions of Gabrielle's fans wanted to know how the story would end. The problem was, Gabrielle didn't know either. How could Eravon defeat such a powerful enemy?

It was late. Gabrielle looked at the page. She had to finish the chapter. The words were dancing in front of her eyes. Slowly, her head fell onto the table.

When Gabrielle woke up, she was standing in a forest, outside a castle.

"Who are you?" said someone.

The man appeared from behind the trees. He was young and handsome, and he carried a bow.

"Eravon?" said Gabrielle, in disbelief.

Gabrielle realised that, somehow, she was inside her own story. And she knew which part this was.

"Hurry!" she shouted. "Moros has captured the Princess. He's in the castle right now, and he's going to take the Jewel!"

"How do you know this? Are you a witch? Can you see things far away? Do you know the future?"

Gabrielle had to invent something that her hero would believe.

"I'm the Spirit of Destiny," she said. "You must act now. This is your last chance to save the kingdom. Do you understand?"

"Lead the way!" cried Eravon.

Eravon and Gabrielle charged into the castle. They entered by a small door in one of the towers. Gabrielle knew that the winemaker always left it open. That's what she'd written.

They ran up spiral staircases and through grand halls, until they arrived in the secret chamber where the magical Jewel of Power was kept.

Moros was there. Gabrielle had described him many times, but he was terrifying in person. He was holding his sword against the Princess' neck. He was about to take the Jewel.

"Please, don't hurt her!" cried Eravon.

He laid down his bow and held up his hands. He looked at Gabrielle, his Spirit of Destiny. His anguished eyes said, 'What now?' Gabrielle had no answer.

Moros cackled with laughter. He took the Jewel in his hand. Immediately, he seemed to shine with incredible power, and his sword burst into flames.

"It's mine!" Moros cried. "Now, no one can stop me!"

"Except me," Gabrielle whispered.

"You?" shouted Moros. "You are nobody!"

He threw the Princess aside, charged forward and attacked Gabrielle with his flaming sword. There was a flash of light. Moros' sword bounced off Gabrielle's skin. It didn't even leave a mark.

Moros was so shocked that he dropped both his sword and the Jewel. For a moment, he just stared at her in disbelief. Then he swirled his black cloak around himself, and he disappeared in a puff of smoke.

"What happened?" asked the Princess, astonished.

"The Jewel grants all the power in the world," Gabrielle explained. "But my power is even greater."

"Who are you really?" asked Eravon.

"I am the *author*," said Gabrielle. "I created this world."

Eravon wiped his tears and he helped the Princess to her feet. The gods had not forgotten them, after all.
