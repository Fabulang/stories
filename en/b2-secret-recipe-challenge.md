Mr. Forester, who was known for his delicious homemade desserts, gave a challenge to Clementine, his apprentice. Could she recreate his special fruit cake, without knowing the secret family recipe?

Clementine wanted to prove her culinary skills, so she accepted the challenge calmly, with a smile. But once she got home, she began to panic.

First, she read every cookbook in her collection. Then she browsed countless cooking websites. But none of them had a recipe for anything like Mr. Forester's special fruit cake.

She asked all her friends and family if they'd ever seen a similar cake, but none of them had. She emailed famous chefs, begging them for a hint; but they didn't know the recipe either. It was Mr. Forester's personal secret, and they all wished they knew it, too.

A few days later, Clementine was helping Mr. Forester prepare a tart for a customer, when she noticed the photograph on the wall. It showed Mr. Forester and an elderly woman, standing by a strange fruit tree in a forest. Clementine didn't say anything.

After work, Clementine rushed out. She could tell where the photo was taken, by looking at the landscape in the background. It was on a local hill that was very hard to climb.

When she reached the top, she could immediately smell the aroma of the elusive fruit that made Mr. Forester's cake so special. Clementine carefully gathered the fruit in a basket.

Early the next morning, she meticulously prepared the cake. The kitchen smelled delightful as it baked in the oven. When Mr. Forester arrived, he smelled it immediately, and rushed into the kitchen.

When the cake was ready, Clementine presented it proudly to Mr. Forester. He carefully took a bite. His eyes widened, and slowly he began to smile.

"I didn't expect you to find the secret," he laughed. "I wanted to see how you would create a similar flavour. It was a test of your knowledge of different ingredients."

Clementine was worried that she had failed the challenge.

"Instead, you have shown me that you are determined and resourceful. That is something even more important, because I can't teach you those things."

Clementine beamed with pride. Years later, she gave the same challenge to her own apprentice. She wondered whether he would notice the photograph of her with Mr. Forester on the wall.
