Jacklyn was an ambitious archaeologist. In her research, she had found numerous references to a powerful ancient artefact. Her colleagues kept telling her it was a myth, but Jacklyn knew the evidence was too strong. It had to really exist.

Jacklyn's theory was that an ancient civilisation had hidden the artefact to protect the world from its power. But they left clues, in case they ever needed to find it again. Jacklyn had found those clues, but they didn't fit together. Something was missing.

One day, a young woman came into her office holding an ancient scroll. "My name is Angelica," she said. "My family has guarded this scroll for generations."

Jacklyn saw instantly that it was the final piece of the puzzle.

"This will take me years to decipher!" Jacklyn groaned.

"I can read it," said Angelica. "My mother taught me the language. That's why I'm coming with you, as your translator."

Their quest led them to hidden tombs in Egypt, underwater caves in Greece and abandoned monasteries in the Himalayas. In a crumbling tomb beneath Rome, a boulder almost ended Jacklyn's quest permanently. Angelica pushed her away just in time.

Finally, they uncovered a temple in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. Its stone door was carved with symbols in the ancient language. Angelica read it aloud, and the door creaked open.

Everything was dark inside, except for a strange light. A golden orb was floating above a pedestal in the middle of the chamber.

Jacklyn opened her bag and took the orb. As soon as her hand touched it, she was granted its power. Suddenly, she could read Angelica's mind. She knew her secret.

"Why didn't you tell me you're my niece?" she asked her, astonished.

"I'm sorry. You and my dad don't talk to each other," said Angelica. "I thought you wouldn't talk to me either, if you knew who I was."

"Your father and I fought about my search for this artefact," Jacklyn confessed, her voice choked with emotion. "He said I was obsessed, insane. I didn't mind when my colleagues said that. But my own brother! I was so angry... I said some horrible things... which I regret."

Angelica smiled. "But he'll have to believe you now!"

"No," Jacklyn said sadly but firmly, putting the orb back above the pedestal.

"Why not?"

"The power of this orb... the ability to read minds... it could bring about chaos. It must stay hidden. Forever."

Jacklyn set fire to the ancient scroll. Angelica didn't stop her, because she knew she was right.

As the flames danced, Jacklyn knew she could never prove her theory, either to the world or to her brother. But once the scroll was gone, she felt an enormous weight lift from her shoulders.

"Time to go home," she said with a great sigh. "I'll give your dad a call."
