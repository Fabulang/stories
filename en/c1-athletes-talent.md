The streets of ancient Elis were bustling with activity. Men and women in tunics went about their business, traders pushed carts full of goods to sell at the market, and children played games in the gravel.

But Elpidios sat with his head between his knees. He had travelled to Elis to follow his dream and become an athlete. But he was a poor farmer, and he couldn't afford to pay for anyone to train him.

All the trainers agreed he had talent. But they didn't want students who had talent. They wanted students who had money.

"Dreaming of the Olympic Games?" came a voice.

Elpidios looked up. An elderly man with a long beard was talking to him.

"Yes," Elpidios sighed. "I'm fast. I know I can win the race across the stadium, if I train. But I can't afford a trainer. I'm a failure. I travelled halfway across Greece ---"

"Shut up and get up," the old man interrupted, sternly.

Elpidios stood up, a little shocked.

"I'm not a trainer," said the old man. "But I know you have talent. I know that if you believe in your dream, you can achieve it. And I know how to help you."

Elpidios and the mysterious man met at sunrise every day. The man helped Elpidios to exercise, to improve his technique, and to challenge himself to run faster and faster. In the evening, Elpidios shared his dinner with the man. There was no other payment.

Months passed, until at last the Olympic Games began. Elpidios registered as a competitor. The other athletes were taller than him. They wore beautiful coloured tunics, and wore jewellery. They laughed at Elpidios when he arrived with the old man at his side.

"Remember everything I taught you," said the old man before the race began. "But most important of all, remember that you are now an Olympic athlete. Enjoy your dream."

The athletes took off their clothes, and lined up at one end of the stadium. Elpidios placed his foot against the starting stone. He breathed deeply. The other end of the stadium seemed very far away. Then the rope dropped, and the runners dashed forward like lightning.

After the race, the old man found Elpidios with his head between his legs, outside the stadium.

"Second place is an extraordinary achievement," said the trainer.

"But I didn't win. I won't receive any honour. I failed!"

"I have only one lesson left to teach you, Elpidios. Forty years ago, I was a farmer, like you. I dreamed of competing in the Olympic Games. I achieved my dream. I ran in the race. I came second."

Elpidios was amazed. "What did you do next?"

"I was angry. I was ashamed. I never ran again. I wasted my talent."

The old man offered his hand, and pulled Elpidios to his feet.

"Don't make my mistake."
