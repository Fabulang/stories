George was a highly successful businessman, known for his acumen and sharp memory. Yet, there was one thing he could never remember -- his wife's birthday. His wife, Margaret, was always patient, yet every forgotten birthday was a prick in her heart.

One year, George made a solemn vow. "Margaret," he said, "I swear on my life, I won't forget next year."

"You say that every year," said Margaret, downcast.

"But this time I cannot fail," said George.

"How's that?" she asked.

"Because I will set an alarm!" replied George, and Margaret rolled her eyes.

As her next birthday approached, Margaret saw George become increasingly restless. She couldn't tell if it was because he was planning something, or because he was worried he would forget. Or perhaps he was just busy with work.

On the morning of the birthday, George's alarm rang out. He sprang out of bed instantly, in a complete panic. He began to dress frantically. "I'm late for work!" he muttered.

Margaret had only just woken up. She murmured, "But it's a Sunday, George..."

"I need to finish that project before Monday!" he hissed.

Then he was gone, and the sound of his car on the gravel came moments later. Margaret could only watch in disappointment as he sped away. He had forgotten once again.

Overwhelmed with frustration, Margaret decided to confront him. She dressed, skipped breakfast, and drove after him to his office.

When she opened the office door, her jaw dropped. There was a burst of camera flashes, and a chorus of "Happy Birthday!" filled the room. There was George, grinning ear to ear.

In front of her was a sea of all her friends' faces, and a sumptuous spread of her favourite foods. Then her favourite songs began to play. The office had been transformed into the best party venue she could have hoped for.

George walked up to her, chuckling at her stunned face. "Why are you surprised?" he said. "I told you this morning, I was going to the office to finish a project!"
