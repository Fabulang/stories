The ships Håkon built were the pride of the Vikings' fleet, and the terror of their enemies. They cut through the waves like swords, and were as strong and reliable as steel.

Håkon had built ships all his life. He began as an apprentice and soon became a master craftsman. He developed new techniques and ingenious designs. As the years passed, Håkon's ships became faster, tougher and more powerful.

But Håkon never wanted to build ships. He wanted to sail them. He wanted to feel the salt spray on his face, the deck under his feet, the thrill of adventure and battle. More than anything, he wanted to be a warrior.

One evening, Håkon watched the warriors climb aboard his latest ship, the *Giant Slayer*. Their gleaming axes and wild eyes filled the ship with a raw energy that tugged at Håkon's heart. He made a sudden decision. He sneaked aboard and hid among the barrels, below the deck.

During the day, Håkon stayed hidden. But at night, when everyone was asleep, he stole some food and crept up onto the deck. He walked around in the moonlight, breathing the salty air. He placed his hands on the wooden planks, and felt his ship move with the ocean, like a living creature.

On the seventh day, Håkon heard a lot of shouting. There were heavy footsteps on the planks above him. The next moment, the whole ship shook violently.

Håkon ran onto the deck. Everyone was too panicked to notice him. They were throwing things into the water -- spears, barrels, helmets. Then Håkon saw what they were attacking. A huge tentacle swung through the air. It was a giant squid, twice as big as the ship.

"Raise the sail!" Håkon shouted.

The warriors saw him. They didn't have time to ask why he was there. "Do it!" shouted the captain.

Håkon helped the men raise the sail as fast as they could. Soon, the wind increased their speed, and they got away from the monster. But it was still hungry. It chased them with ferocious energy.

Håkon shouted more instructions, and the crew worked quickly. He used his intricate knowledge of the ship's design to find ways to make it sail even faster. But the squid was unstoppable.

"It's catching us!" cried one of the warriors.

They watched in horror as the squid raised its huge, ugly head and wrapped its tentacles around the ship's mast.

The captain handed Håkon a spear. "It's the last one," he said.

Håkon gripped the wooden spear. He felt its weight. Years of working with tools had made his hands skilful, his arms strong, his eyes sharp. He launched the spear. It hit the giant squid in the centre of its single red eye.

"And that's how I became a warrior," said Håkon to his grandson, as he finished telling the story. "I was a humble ship builder. I dared to follow my heart. Now people call me the 'Giant Slayer'."
