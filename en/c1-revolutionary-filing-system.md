Emile was a secretary in a bustling company. It was a nice place to work, but he was overlooked and underappreciated. His boss was a rather stern woman, Mrs. Boxer, who had a habit of chiding him for his disorganised desk.

"Emile," she would sigh, tapping her foot impatiently, "this desk is a disaster. You'll never get that promotion if you can't even sort your pens and pencils properly."

Fed up with the disrespect, Emile devised a plan. He invented a complex filing system that only he could understand. It was a labyrinth of codes, symbols, and colours, undecipherable to anyone but him.

When Mrs. Boxer first saw the new system, she was impressed. The filing system seemed sophisticated. However, she couldn't locate a single document without his help.

"Emile," she grumbled, riffling through a stack of coded papers, "what does this symbol mean? And why is this paper purple?"

"It's all part of my highly organised system," said Emile knowingly.

"Good job," she admitted grudgingly. However, even as she grew more impressed as the weeks went by, she still refused to promote him.

Word of Emile's revolutionary system eventually reached the CEO. Emile was summoned to the CEO's office, and told to give a demonstration of his special system.

"It's genius," the CEO exclaimed, thoroughly impressed. "Emile, I want you to work directly for me."

Elated and triumphant, Emile accepted the promotion on the spot.

Now that his talents had finally been recognised, Emile carefully adjusted his system to make it easier for others to understand. But his older, more complex system, still lived on in his old boss's office. Emile still saw her sometimes, looking confused, with a disorganised pile of documents around her.
