Charlie was an extraordinary scientist. Despite his brilliance, the prestigious science journal, *Our Times*, persistently rejected his papers. The editor's letter of rejection would always conclude that Charlie's ideas were too radical.

His friends comforted him. "Charlie, you're ahead of your time," they would say.

The thought sparked an idea. If he was ahead of his time, he could invent a way to travel into the future, to a society that would appreciate his genius.

With unwavering dedication, Charlie created a time machine. He set the coordinates to thousands of years in the future and launched himself into a brave new world.

In the future, he witnessed astounding sights. Cities floated in the sky, held aloft by invisible forces. Majestic beasts from prehistoric times mingled with neon-hued creatures of the cosmos in sprawling parks. People communicated telepathically, their words creating ripples of colour in the air. Machines were self-replicating, capable of evolution, and humans navigated the stars as easily as the oceans.

In this remarkable future, Charlie discovered that the science journal, *Our Times*, was still being published. He navigated to their digital headquarters and asked to speak to the chief editor. An artificial intelligence, which introduced itself as Editor X-9, greeted him.

Charlie revealed dramatically that he was a time traveller. He asked if the journal would now consider publishing his work.

Editor X-9 paused. "Time travel?" it said.

"Precisely," said Charlie. "I can prove it. If you will allow me to show you---"

"Oh, it's not that I don't believe you," said Editor X-9. "Time travel was discovered hundreds of years ago. It's as common now as riding a bicycle was in the past. How do you think we have so many dinosaurs around?"

Charlie was speechless.

"I've analysed your machine. It's quite rudimentary. We teach a similar design in primary school."

"But---"

"Regrettably, we still cannot publish your work," the editor concluded. "It seems, Charlie, you are now behind the times."
