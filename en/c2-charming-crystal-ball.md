In the dusty corners of her college dorm's basement, Naomi, an ever-superstitious student, discovered a relic from a bygone era: an old crystal ball. Seized by curiosity and an impulsive need for guidance, Naomi decided to employ the relic in making life-altering decisions.

First, she probed the crystal ball about her budding feelings for a classmate. "Should I ask him out?" she inquired, her voice echoing in the dimly lit room. In the depth of the crystal ball, a one-word response materialised: Yes. Mustering her courage, she followed the advice and was thrilled when the boy reciprocated her feelings.

With newfound trust in the crystal ball's counsel, she sought its fashion advice for her first date. Should she wear her finest dress? To her surprise, the crystal ball suggested a simple pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Overcoming initial scepticism, she adhered to its directive. Her date's compliment on her refreshing simplicity fortified her faith in the crystal ball's wisdom.

Time went on, and her reliance on the crystal ball seemed to pay off. Her love life blossomed, and every piece of advice from the enigmatic orb turned out beneficial.

Some months later, Naomi had an argument with her boyfriend that left her feeling distressed. She sought the crystal ball's guidance, but for the first time, it had no response at all. She shook it and tried again, but it would not answer her.

Perplexed by its sudden silence, Naomi inspected the object and discovered a hidden battery compartment. She pried open the compartment, took out the old battery, and was surprised to read the label underneath: "Random Answer Generator."

The revelation that her trusted advisor was nothing but a toy struck her. But it meant that the crystal ball had never really contributed to her successful relationship. It was her authenticity and charisma that had charmed her boyfriend all along.

With a smile, Naomi dialled her boyfriend's number, excited to reconcile. She realised there had been magic in her life after all, just not from the crystal ball.
