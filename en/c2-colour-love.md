In the year thirty-two-o-two, society is composed of both humans and aliens, living together peacefully as equal citizens.

Felicity was a human girl taking a course in alien cultures at university, and she was in love with her classmate Xeep. Xeep was an alien whose species was renowned for its emotive skin. When he was concentrating in class, his skin was the colour of the sky. But when he felt really enthusiastic about the lesson, his skin shone with all the colours of a sunrise. It was enchanting.

Felicity was failing the class, because she spent so much time admiring Xeep. She knew this couldn't carry on. She should either tell him how she felt, or move on. She hadn't listened much in class, but she knew Xeep's species preferred courtship to be speedy and direct, and that rejected lovers were treated with impeccable respect.

So, one day, she mustered her courage and approached him after class.

"I want you, Xeep," she said timidly, her heart pounding.

She had expected him to be taken aback. Instead, he looked at her from head to toe. Then he shifted colours to a passionate red.

"I want you too, Felicity," Xeep said in his soft, melodic voice. Felicity turned bright red too. "Why don't you come to my home this evening?"

Felicity was thrilled speechless. She spent the rest of the day getting ready, and was practically dancing on Xeep's doorstep that night.

Xeep's home was a fascinating blend of human and alien aesthetics, with many unexpected features. Felicity looked around in wonder. The lights were on the floor rather than the ceiling. She looked up, and saw exotic plants hanging down, their tendrils glowing with soft colours in tandem with Xeep's mood.

Each room had a different colour scheme -- there was blue in the entrance hall, green in the living room and she could see purple in the bathroom. Some of the furniture was so bizarre that Felicity couldn't work out what it was for. She wanted to ask Xeep so many questions, but she was afraid of offending him. She wished she'd paid more attention in class.

"May I offer you some liquid?" asked Xeep, remembering that humans needed to drink. He walked to his kitchen, which was decorated in crimson hues. "You require water, isn't that correct?"

Felicity suddenly remembered something, and her fluttering heart turned to ice in an instant.

She started backing away towards the door, pushing through the hanging plants that had begun glowing a fiery red. "I'm sorry Xeep," she stammered. "I apologise. I just remembered... I feel unwell. Would you mind if I ---"

She reached the door, turned quickly and tried to pull it open. It was locked.

"What's wrong, my little sweet?" asked Xeep, with a big smile that showed his teeth.

"In human culture," she whimpered, "red represents love and desire. But in your culture..."

"Hunger," said Xeep.
